    "# USING PYTHON FOR POINT CLOUD PROCESSING\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will enable you to go through many, often fundamental steps in the processing of point clouds, particularly in the context of their use in the Built Environment context, such as Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is organised in 11 sections:\n",
    "1. Environment Setup\n",
    "2. Load Files (e.g. point clouds) to be processed\n",
    "3. Visualize point cloud\n",
    "4. Down-sample point cloud\n",
    "5. Calculate point normals\n",
    "6. Extract planes or patches\n",
    "7. Classify patches\n",
    "8. Extract edges\n",
    "9. Save results\n",
    "10. Scan-vs-BIM (colour-coding based on point-mesh proximity)\n",
    "11. Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation using Machine Learning (required Google Colab)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook will sometimes simply give you the code to run. But, in other times, it will only give you the main function that must be employed and you then have to work out how to use (e.g. identify the necessary input and possibly format it as necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebooks can be run with Jupyter Notebook (e.g. through Anaconda) except for Section 11. It can otherwise be run with Google Colab. The cells specific to Google Colab (e.g. to load data from Google Drive in Google Colab) are highlighted."

Open3D provides a built-in RANSAC function called *segment_plane()* that can return the plane that has the largest support in the data, i.e. that has the largest number of points near it. The function is documented at http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/geometry/pointcloud.html#Plane-segmentation. RANSAC ramdomly selected *n* points to fit a plane (*n >=3* points for a plane). It then counts all points that fall in the neighborhood of the plane (e.g. +/- 3cm from the plane). This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations. The plane with the most support is then returned by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method only gives the one plane with the largest support. Therefore, to extract many planes in the data, the method needs to be applied multiple times, with the point cloud at each iteration set as the point cloud used as input minus all the points that are part of the support of the plane extracted at the previous iteration.\n",
